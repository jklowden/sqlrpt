_sqlrpt_ is a command-line tool for viewing and printing SQLite output.  It renders output that can be processed with **tbl**(1), part of the groff suite of utilities.  Groff is packaged with most Linux distributions, BSDs, OS X, and is available for Windows.  When used with **nroff**(1) it makes for convenient in-terminal viewing.

To build _sqlrpt_, type **make** (requires GNU make).  To install, **make install**.  

To use _sqlrpt_, see the accompanying man page.
